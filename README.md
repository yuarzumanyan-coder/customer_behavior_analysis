# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data ingestion, exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through a clear dashboard and professional reports suitable for business stakeholders.

The project highlights practical skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and communication of results.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Public / provided dataset (CSV format)
* **Content:** Structured tabular data containing numerical and categorical variables
* **Size:** Medium-sized dataset suitable for exploratory and analytical tasks
* **Purpose:** Used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs)

> Note: The dataset was cleaned and transformed before analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

  * Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **SQL:** PostgreSQL Server for querying and analysis
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma:** Presentation (PPT) creation
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Analysis and documentation

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported the dataset into Python using pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data structure and distributions.
   * Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   * Generated summary statistics and visualizations.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing and duplicate values.
   * Standardized data types and column names.
   * Created derived features where necessary.

4. **SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)**

   * Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
   * Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.
   * Used joins, aggregations, and filters for analysis.

5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

   * Built an interactive dashboard with key KPIs.
   * Added filters and slicers for user-driven exploration.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a written report summarizing insights.
   * Designed a professional presentation (PPT) using Gamma.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis over time
* Category-based comparisons
* Interactive filters for deeper insights

The dashboard is designed for clarity, usability, and decision-making support.

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns within the data.
* Highlighted areas of improvement and opportunities.
* Translated raw data into actionable insights through visuals and summaries.

The results demonstrate the ability to connect data analysis with real-world business questions.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Set up a Python environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Load the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL and run the SQL scripts provided.

5. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.

## Notes

* This project is intended for portfolio and learning purposes.
* The structure and workflow reflect real-world data analytics practices.
